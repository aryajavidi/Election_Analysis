## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this election audit analysis is to is to identify which country has the largest turnout of voters, the voter turnout for each county, and the percentage of votes from each county out of the total. This analysis can be used to identify trends or information within the datasets regarding voter turnout and total votes which can then be used by campaigning parties to make decisions on where to campaign and strategies to use while campaigning in certain counties. 


### Purpose

The objective of this election audit activity is to use Python to write a text file containing information regarding each county and their percentage of the total votes among other important statistics. This activity tests our ability to code in Python and use proper syntax to create a table with proper formatting with out exported data. We also had to import the election data within python by importing our OS and loading the spreadsheet from its filepath. This activity tested our abilities to import, analyze, and export data within python.

## Election-Audit Summary

The script that we have created in this activity would be a wonderful asset for local or federal government to gather insight regarding voter turnout and develop strategies to improve voter turnout in areas with significantly lower numbers or increase promotion and campaigning in counties or states with significantly higher voter turnout. 

If we were to repurpose this to be used for analyzing voter turnout for a federal election, we could use this script to identify voter turnout by state rather than by county and identify which states had higher or lower voter turnout and which candidates they voted for. Another way we could change this script to provide more detailed analysis would be to include the breakdown of votes per candidate per county to help identify which counties lean towards which side primarily.
